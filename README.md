## Summary

This repository stores relevant data sets, and rmarkdown code for analysis of water discharge and sediment loads on the Elwha River. Analysis focuses on the time frame during and after the removal of Glines Canyon Dam and the Elwha Dam, both on the Elwha River, Washington. 

The dataset begins when the removal project begins, September 15, 2011. The Glines Canyon Dam was removed not long after, and the project officially ended on August 26, 2014, but the data was collected until September 30, 2016. Data was recorded by the USGS gage station with identification number- 12046260, which can be found downstream of the old dams sites at the diversion near Port Angeles, Washington.

An understanding of changes on the Elwha River during and following the dam removal process can be understood from analysis on daily water discharge, and parameters surrounding sediment concentration, bedload, size of sediment, and sediment discharge. Looking at changes of these parameters over time in accordance with the time stamps of the project can help explain how long it takes a river to reach a new stability of discharge and sediment discharge following dam removal.
